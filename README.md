These directories contain Python scripts for plotting/analysing model output.

Python scripts can be found in the directory 'Program'.
Model output can be found in the directory 'Data'.

The model output are stored as NETCDF files, most output is converted to seasonally and/or yearly averages for data storage.
Only for the genesis potential index (GPI), the entire present-day and future ensemble mean is already determined.
